# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the app

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

3. To run this on an iOS simulator. Ensure you have XCode downloaded (You need a Macbook for this). Alternatively, if you use `npx expo start`, once it is running you can press `i` to swtich to iOS sim.

    ```bash
    npx expo run:ios
    ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Building and Deploying with EAS

This project uses [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) to create native builds for iOS and Android. Here's how to get started:

1. Install EAS CLI globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g eas-cli
    ```

2. Login to your Expo account:

    ```bash
    eas login
    ```

3. Configure your project (if not already done):

    ```bash
    eas build:configure
    ```

4. Deploy your backend first:

    - Deploy your backend to Vercel to get your API URL
    - You'll need this URL for configuring your app's environment variables

5. Set up environment variables:

    EAS uses secure environment variables for managing sensitive configuration. Set these up before building:

    ```bash
    eas secret:create --scope project --name API_URL --value "https://your-backend.vercel.app"
    ```

    Required environment variables:

    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL`: URL for uploading images
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS`: iOS public key for paywall
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL`: Live API URL generated by Vercel after backend deployment

    You can also manage these variables in the EAS dashboard under your project settings.

6. Create a build:

    - For iOS development:
        ```bash
        eas build --platform ios --profile development
        ```
    - For Android development:
        ```bash
        eas build --platform android --profile development
        ```
    - For production builds:
        ```bash
        eas build --platform all --profile production
        ```

7. Submit to stores:
    - For iOS:
        ```bash
        eas submit -p ios
        ```
    - For Android:
        ```bash
        eas submit -p android
        ```
