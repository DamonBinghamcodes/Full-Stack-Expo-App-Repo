# Expo Starter Monorepo

Hi and welcome to the Expo Starter repo!  
I'm **Bailey Parker** (@bpthedev), and this is a minimal monorepo setup designed to help you move fast.

This repo contains three projects â€” a website, a mobile app, and a backend â€” managed together in a raw monorepo structure. Each project is committed from the root repo and deployed independently.

> ðŸ“¹ A full documentation walkthrough video is coming soon.

This repo has been created as a template repo inside of GitHub, so to get started, simply click the "Use this template" button at the top right of the repo, and then just choose where you would like to create the repo.

---

## Structure

- `website/` â€“ a Next.js web frontend
- `app/` â€“ an Expo mobile app (deployed via EAS Build)
- `backend/` â€“ a Next.js API backend with Better Auth + Prisma

Each project includes its own `.env.example` file to help you get your environment variables set up quickly.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Each project is self-contained. Here's a quick overview of how to get each one running.

When deploying:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and select "Add New Project."
2. Choose this monorepo from your GitHub repositories.
3. Vercel will prompt you to pick which directory to deploy â€“ select `website`.
4. Add the required environment variables (from `.env.example`).
